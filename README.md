# CounterCurse
CounterCurse is a program that automaticly censors out inapropriate languge.

## Who is this for?
ANYONE! I primarily use this for video editing, and that's what I initally designed it for, but there are plenty of people who use it on podcasts or movies that have cuss words that either they or there children don't feel comfortable hearing. Note from my lawyers: You should only do this on media the you have LEGALY aquired.

## FAQ
**When will a windows and mac OS version be avaliable?**
Very soon, YOu can expect the windows version to be released in aproxemently a month, probably sooner. However, the Mac OS release is a little bit more complicated, trying to release an app for Mac OS is a lot more time consuming.

**Is this compatable with any languages other then english?**
Short anwser, not yet. Long anwser, I am only fluent in english. Je parle un peu français, mais pas beaucoup. So you can expect a french update evntully, and perhaps others as well. If you speak another language we would LOVE your help translating, and yes, even if you speak french, because I only know a few good curses en français. P.S. Sorry to all who can actually speak french well.

**Am I aloud to use this for commercial use?**
It depends on what you mean by commercial use, you are absolutly aloud to use this program on for profit films, movies productions, etc. I made this program for that exact purpose. HOWEVER, you are not aloud to sell/distribute this program with out the express writen permission by me. And yes, that even includes remixes of this project. But by all means feel free to edit and share your edited versions of this program if you do so FOR FREE!

**Can I add my own custom words to be censored?**
Not yet, but that feture is coming extreamly soon. As of now, the only way to do that is by edditing the code.


### Warnings
*AMD has some compatibility issues with whisper, some tinkering may be required to get it to work.
